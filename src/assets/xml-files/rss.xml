Issue with caching:<br />
Setup:<br />
- cache busting is enabled for all assets<br />
- no cache headers are set<br />
- version is updated with every release in the package.json (helps with ngsw-worker) <br />
- site hotested on Azure app service <br /><br />
If we add a new route and serve that route directly, the route does not seem to found and 404 is served. Checking the network, it shows that ngsw-worked downloads from server the latest index.html and latest assets/scripts. When served the second time, the new route is properly served.<br /><br />
I am looking for an expert (with very good knowledge of these type of issues in particular) to debug this together with us. Looking for immediate availability. <br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $25.00-$45.00
